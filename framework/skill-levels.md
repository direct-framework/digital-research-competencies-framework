# DIRECT Framework - Skill Level Definitions

## Introduction

This document describes a competency scale as a tool to help a wide range of digital research technical professionals (dRTPs) to describe their ability to demonstrate a particular skill (i.e. an individual’s competency level for a particular skill) within the [DIRECT competency framework][direct-framework].
The scale can serve as a guide to understanding the expected proficiency at each level (i.e. the expected proficiency of top performers at each level and what an individual is expected to be able to do/aim for at the top of a particular skill level).
It can be used by an individual to compare their current level of proficiency to that of individuals at the level above or top performers at the same level.

The skills that dRTPs draw on can be broadly divided into **technical** and **non-technical**.
Technical skills cover specialist, discipline-related expertise such as programming, data analysis, software engineering, use of digital infrastructures (e.g. HPC and cloud), and reproducible research practices.
Non-technical skills encompass wider professional competencies that enable effective practice and collaboration.
These include cognitive and reflective abilities (analysis, problem-solving, creativity, self-reflection), emotional and interpersonal skills (empathy, conflict resolution, cultural awareness), professional and personal maturity (time management, adaptability, resilience, ethical integrity), as well as social awareness and systems thinking (EDIA, mental health awareness, and business acumen).
Our skills scale needs to apply equally well to both technical and non-technical skills and work across the spectrum.

We also expect the scale to be a useful tool for curriculum design and planning professional and personal development for skills within the DIRECT framework.
For this reason - we provide a mapping of our scale to the hierarchical cognitive (knowledge-based - useful for technical skills) and affective (emotion-based - useful for non-technical skills) levels in the [Blooms taxonomy][blooms-taxonomy].
[Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy) describes hierarchical learning objectives an individual is aiming to achieve at each level/phase of (cognitive or emotional) development from the lowest-order processes to the highest.

Mapping to Bloom’s taxonomy can be used to aid the design and development of curricula and defining learning objectives at each skill/competency level as learners advance through the process of learning or awareness,
from the fundamental stages of remembering and understanding to the more complex stages of evaluating and creating.

## Skills Scale

We use the following 4-level skill scale - which maps directly to the scale defined by the [UK Government Science and Engineering’s Career Framework][gse-framework].

### Level 0 - None or N/A

Does not possess the skill or ability or not required to apply or demonstrate this skill in a role or it is not applicable to the role.

### Level 1 - Awareness
*Fundamental awareness (basic knowledge) or fundamental ability*

- Technical: has a common knowledge and understands basic techniques and concepts; able to follow instructions or use skill in a limited context or perform simple tasks with support.
- Non-technical: recognises the importance of the skill, shows initial effort, applies it inconsistently or only in simple contexts.

Focus is on **learning** and **remembering**.

### Level 2 - Working
*Novice (limited experience) or emerging ability*

Understands and can discuss terminology, concepts, principles and issues related to this competency.

- Technical: has the level of experience gained in a classroom or as a trainee on-the-job; expected to need help when performing this skill; can use the full range of reference and resource materials in this skill.
- Non-technical: can apply the skill with some independence in familiar situations; beginning to reflect on practice and adapt behaviour.

Focus is on **understanding** and developing through on-the-job experience.

### Level 3 - Practitioner
*Intermediate practitioner (practical application)*

- Technical: confidently applies skills across a range of tasks; adapts solutions to challenges and supports peers; help from an expert may be required from time to time; understands and can discuss the application and implications of changes to processes and policies in this area; contributes toå reference and resource materials in this skill.
- Non-technical: uses the skill consistently and effectively; demonstrates maturity, self-reflection, and constructive interaction with others; communicates the relevant topics in sufficient detail during discussions and presentations for a range of audiences to foster a greater understanding among internal and external colleagues and collaborators.

Focus is on **applying** well-known practices, algorithms, paradigms and solutions to the job at hand and **enhancing knowledge or skill**.

### Level 4 – Expert
*Advanced practitioner, expert or recognised authority*

- Technical: highly skilled, performs tasks associated with this skill without assistance; handles complex, unfamiliar challenges, recognised as "a person to ask" or mentors others, create new applications for and/or lead the development of reference and resource materials for this competency; and integrates skills into wider systems, projects or organisations.
- Non-technical: exemplary use of the skill; adapts flexibly to complex situations, mentors others, and contributes to broader cultural or systemic improvements.

Focus is on **designing or architecting** new solutions, creating **strategy** in the skill area and **shaping organisational and (inter)national policies** - **analysing, evaluating** and **creating/synthesis**.
